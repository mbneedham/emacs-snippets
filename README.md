==============
 misc. bits of elisp I use in my .emacs

* buffer-kill-prompt.el: prompt the user before killing a modified buffer that isn't associated with a file

* mwheel-scroll-all: make scroll-all-mode work with the mouse wheel	

* narrow-indirect.el: narrow-to-defun or narrow-to-region using indirect buffers
